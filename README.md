# Gallery

Basically an image gallery. It pulls in every (defined in `formats.txt`) image inside `/images` and displays them.

I threw this together to quickly display images that I print off for my children to color. I'm sharing it because my GitHub activity is terrible.

Enjoy, or don't.

## Image extensions

You can decide which extensions to use by editing `formats.txt` split your extentions with a `,`. Submit a pull request if you find any that matter that should be included.

## Categories

Category support exists. Just create subdirectories inside the `/images` directory. They will auto display. The main page still displays every image inside the `/images` directory.
