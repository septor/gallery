# Gallery

Basically an image gallery. It pulls in every* image inside `/images` and displays them.

I threw this together to quickly display images that I print off for my children to color. I'm sharing it because my GitHub activity is terrible.

Enjoy, or don't.

* Supported formats are `jpg,gif,png,jpeg,svg`. You can modify line 16 (extensions are in curly braces) to include additional formats. Cause that's a possibility.
